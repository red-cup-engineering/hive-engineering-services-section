// posting — PREPARED BUT LOCKED. Content composition with the broadcast door
// bolted shut pending human review.
//
// The platform must be *ready* to post (compose drafts, attach tags and
// beneficiaries, target the right parent for replies) without being *able* to
// post autonomously. So this lane builds a complete, signable draft and stops:
// `composeDraft` produces the exact `comment` payload the upstream client would
// broadcast, and `executePost` REFUSES — `posting` is a locked capability
// (config.LOCKED_CAPABILITIES), enable-able only by a human editing source after
// reviewing the lane. There is no runtime flag that arms it. The draft is the
// deliverable; the broadcast is a human decision.
//
// (The actual broadcast, once a human unlocks it, is the upstream
// `HiveClient.post` / `.comment` — this lane would only hand it the draft.)
