// analysis/signals — two more chain-data reads that are free from substrate we
// already capture (#29, the no-extra-fetch half).
//
//   • Signed-vote frustration. active_votes carry NEGATIVE rshares — downvotes.
//     A post with both up- and down-vote mass is contested: a signed graph whose
//     frustration (the share of vote mass fighting the consensus sign) measures
//     controversy. Curating into a downvote war risks our reward being nullified
//     or our stake drawn into a flag fight — so frustration is a penalty, and a
//     purely-downvoted post is a trap to avoid, not a sink to capture.
//
//   • Comment-tree branching. `children` is the post's reply-tree size. High
//     branching = high genuine engagement (eyes, discussion) — legitimacy that
//     distinguishes an organically-rising post from a whale-inflated one. A
//     mild positive signal, normalised across the cohort.
//
// Both are computed from the existing PostSnapshot; no extra chain reads.
