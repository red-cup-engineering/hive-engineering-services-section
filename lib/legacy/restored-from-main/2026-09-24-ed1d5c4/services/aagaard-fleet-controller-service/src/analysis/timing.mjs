// analysis/timing — the HF25 curation-reward time window and the vote-timing
// diffraction spectrum (Voting v2 #13, #23).
//
// This is the single highest-leverage read for CURATION reward, and it lives in
// data nobody bothers with raw: the post's creation time and the per-post
// `active_votes` list — each vote's voter, rshares, and TIMESTAMP. Under two
// lenses it is the difference between capturing a share of the mint and donating
// mana to a cartel:
//
//   1. Curation time window (current mainnet, HF25 "Equilibrium", 2021-06-30).
//      The pre-HF25 five-minute reverse auction — which forfeited early-vote
//      curation back to the pool — was REMOVED. Verified against the chain and
//      the hardfork notes (hive_evaluator_social.cpp, the HF25 announcement):
//        • there is NO early-vote penalty — voting fresh is no longer punished;
//        • the first 24h is a FLAT early window (penalty divisor 1): curation is
//          paid on Hive Power × weight with no time-based diminishment, so fresh
//          content is the best curation target;
//        • the next 48h (24–72h) is the mid window (divisor 2 — half weight);
//        • 72h to the 7-day payout is the late window (divisor 8 — eighth);
//        • once the 7-day cashout passes there is no curation at all.
//      The window factor here is taken DIRECTLY from the upstream chain-exact
//      `curationWindow`/`curationPenaltyDivisor` (1, ½, ⅛, 0), so this heuristic
//      can never drift from the real reward. (This module owns ONLY the time
//      window; curation SATURATION — the pro-rata rshares split — is owned by
//      `analysis/reward`'s captureEfficiency, so the two never double-count.)
//
//   2. Diffraction spectrum. A genuine organic curation has irregularly spaced
//      votes (a broad, high-entropy inter-arrival spectrum). An automated trail
//      or cartel votes in lockstep — a sharp peak in the inter-arrival histogram,
//      low timing entropy: the Riemann-as-prime-diffraction lens (a pure tone =
//      a periodic lattice = a machine). High regularity means the curation
//      reward on that post is already being swept by a bot train; our expected
//      share is small even if the post looks under-priced. The diffraction
//      spectrum is thus a cartel/bot AUTHENTICITY radar over votes.
//
// All native arithmetic over the snapshot's vote rows. No Peano, no float money.
